## üîÅ Typical Data Flow

1. **Country**: Create countries first. Required for players and some teams.
2. **Team**: Create teams, assign `countryId` if `type = INTERNATIONAL`.
3. **Player**: Create player with `countryId`. Can exist without being in a team.
4. **PlayerTeam**: Assign players to teams over time.
5. **Series**: Create a cricket event or tournament with basic metadata.
6. **SeriesHostCountry**: Link series with hosting country/countries.
7. **SeriesTeam**: Register teams playing in a series.
8. **SeriesFormat**: Define match formats (e.g., Test, ODI, T20).
9. **SeriesFormatTeam**: Assign teams to each format.
10. **SeriesFormatTeamPlayer**: Assign players to specific format-teams. Flags for captain/wicketkeeper.

- ‚úÖ Always create `Country` entries first.
- ‚úÖ For `Team`, check if `type = INTERNATIONAL` and assign a country.
- ‚úÖ `Player` must belong to a country but can exist without a team initially.
- ‚úÖ Use `PlayerTeam` for historical player-team tracking.
- ‚úÖ A `Series` can include multiple host countries, formats, and teams.
- ‚úÖ Match formats are linked to `Series` via `SeriesFormat`.
- ‚úÖ Teams per format tracked with `SeriesFormatTeam`.
- ‚úÖ Players per team per format tracked in `SeriesFormatTeamPlayer`.
